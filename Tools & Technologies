 Tools & Technologies
IBM Watson Studio
IBM Watson AutoAI
IBM Cloud Object Storage
Python (for optional scripting & post-processing)
Official Government Datasets from PMGSY/Ministry of Rural Development


Approach:-
Data Upload: Uploaded structured dataset to IBM Cloud Object Storage

AutoAI Configuration:
Selected classification as the problem type
AutoAI split data, selected pipelines, and optimized models
Model Training: Multiple pipelines created, trained, and evaluated

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision / Recall
ROC-AUC

Model Selection: Best performing pipeline chosen based on validation metrics
Deployment: Model made available as a deployable service/API via Watson Machine Learning
